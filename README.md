# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and fun web-based game experience. Players can select their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will generate its choice randomly. The game then displays the result, showing whether the player won, lost, or tied.

## Features

- Interactive UI for selecting rock, paper, or scissors
- Random computer choice generation
- Display of both player's and computer's choices
- Outcome announcement (win, lose, draw)
- Responsive design for play on various devices
